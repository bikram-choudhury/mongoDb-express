# Express + mongoDb Source

This repository holds the basic skeleton of Node App using [express framework](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html),
the foundation for most of the documentation samples and potentially a good starting point for your application.

**This is not the perfect arrangement for your application. It is not designed for production.
It exists primarily to get you started quickly with learning and prototyping in Angular**


## Prerequisites

Node.js, npm, bower and mongodb are essential for express development. 
    
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x`, npm `3.x.x`, bower `1.8.x` and mongodb `3.x.x`
